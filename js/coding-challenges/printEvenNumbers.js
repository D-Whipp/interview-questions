// Print all even numbers from 0 to 10
// Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest characters/commands. While you could simply print the even numbers, get creative and see how you could output them in a way that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort
// let i = 0;
// console.log('hi');
// while (i <= 10) {
//     if (i % 2 === 0) {
//         console.log(i);
//     }
// }
for (let i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
        console.log(i);
    }
}
